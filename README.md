# Lattice Generator
By Rex Greenway

This small project uses python libraries networkx, numpy, and OpenCV to generate and draw lattices layer by layer, working out from the centre.

 <b>V1<\b>
- Hexagon - Generates lattice of hexagons with desired edge length and number of layers input by the user.
- Parrallogram - Generates lattice of paralleograms, with changable internal angle, to fit within a given circle.
