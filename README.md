# Lattice Generator
By Rex Greenway

This small project uses python libraries networkx, numpy, and OpenCV to generate and draw lattices, with edge length 1, layer by layer working out from the centre.

- Hexagon - Generates lattice given the number of layers nput by the user.
- Parrallogram - Generates lattice of paralleograms, with changable internal angle, to fit within a given circle.
