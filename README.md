# Lattice Generator

This small project uses python libraries networkx, numpy, and OpenCV to generate and draw lattices, with edge length 1, layer by layer working out from the centre. Currently the program can generate heaxagonal lattices given the number of layers required as an input, as well as a parrallogram lattice, with changable internal angle, fitting within a given circle.
